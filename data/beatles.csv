The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
Floating down the stream of time

From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take

The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sell me on a silver sun

Hey Jude, don't be afraid

The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na-na-na-na-na

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
