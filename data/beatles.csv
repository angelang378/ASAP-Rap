The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
Floating down the stream of time

From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take

The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sell me on a silver sun

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, yeah

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin

Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play,
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile.

The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Nothing you can make that can't be made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time

The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
