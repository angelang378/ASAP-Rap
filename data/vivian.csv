Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

And think about what you did
Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint, and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa

Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

You can't feel me, I'm lightnin'

You would come in close
And take off all my clothes
Every time I think that I've been takin' the steps
You end up mad at me for makin' a mess

I can't understand, why you don't understand me
Baby
And every day I wake up and I make money for myself
And though we share a bed, you know that I don't need your help
Do you understand?
You don't understand me

Take it to another level
You're more than just anybody
Don't give up, the future starts now

One day, everyone will notice
The world is yours and you should know it
So don't let love get out of focus
(Don't give up, the future starts now)

I know you can take the pressure
Turn it into something better
So take the pain and make it pleasure
Don't give up, the future starts now

Le futur c'est maintenant
Un, deux, trois, quatre

Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up
I won't shut up

To help you with your climb
Or rather, to help the bodies that you step over, along your route
So they won't hurt like mine

Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up
I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want

Nothing to do but we can drive to nowhere maybe we'll drink a few and
We'll give each other that same tattoo we'll stay past our

Lights and even with our eyes closed tight I feel the heat of you and

Not for nothin' I've foreseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
No more chances, if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Penitentiary chances, the devil dances
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random

But we stay winnin', this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy endin' and a new beginnin'
And a new fitted, and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?

Ain't no question, if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly driftin' away from me
I'm on the edge, so why you playin'? I'm sayin'
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

Is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missin'
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standin' at attention

Waiting here to find the sign

Drinking wine, feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign

That I should take it slow

Off again did he go
To another dimension my mind
Body, soul imprisoned my eye
Probably going ballistic but listen
I'm missing a couple of screws
They ain't never do dreaming true, you been sipping away at the truth
But besides the wisdom I do-do-do
Rolling do, hitting switches, rolling ditches, blowing kisses
To the bitches, hold the biscuits, what's the business
Beat the system, cold defendants
Blow the symptoms, go to prison
Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fucking good most dykes'll fuck me buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit
I know I plead the fifth
I tell her holla if ya need some dick
The devotion it's getting hopeless
Behold it I'm getting closest
My soul is I'm seeing ghosts
A solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions

Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem

I was in the dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya

I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a dead-head zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up
You should set if off, tell me, ""Time's up""
Let the water run, let my body run

Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it

You feel like you're dropping out of sight

Woah-oh

Well he's torn himself to pieces and each night he feels the itch
To grab the needle, thread and scalpel. He'll gather, slice and stich
And he'll build a brand new person where the current person sits
Until he's nothing but a patchwork of other people's greatest hits

And every lost evening while time ticks ever on
He sings for his supper goes home to write songs
Waits for some signal, waits for some break
To make him feel better he'll say

I wanna dance like Gene Kelly
Dress like Elton John
Give those kids who get me a star to wish upon
Tell the world I'm ready
To write their favourite song

Think of me as someone, someone that you know

I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassin'
Don't send me photos, you're makin' it worse
'Cause you're so hot it's hurtin' my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe

The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you 'cause I find it hard to take
When people run in circles, it's a very, very
