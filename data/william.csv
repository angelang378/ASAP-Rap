We'll pick up right where we left off

Blinding lights and disheartened hope

One mistake is all it really takes
To take my breath away
Go on put the knife in

Run away, don't need you anyway
Although I wish you'd stay
Go on put the knife in

And I've been stupid
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

To take my breath away
Go and put the knife in

I hear voices inside my head

You're a criminal
And you steal like you're a pro

So ashamed, so confused
I was broken and bruised

Now I'm a warrior
Now I've got thicker skin
I'm a warrior
I'm stronger than I've ever been
And my armor, is made of steel, you can't get in
I'm a warrior
And you can never hurt me again

And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long
I know I've grown, but I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to Tiny Dancer
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes

Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken

Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home

With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night
I see love in your eyes
And if you see it in mine
Let's wait 'til tomorrow
Don't say good, say good
Please, don't say goodnight

Check cashed and I'm ready for the weekend
Blow it all, making memories with my friends
Two girls on my lap, super packed in
(It's alright, it's alright)
Plug the iPod in, put on ASAP
Hella loud, tryna rap, ""You can't rap!""
In her work uniform, but she's still bad
(It's alright, it's alright)

Take a deep breath and don't be shy
Don't you worry about tomorrow
'Cause tomorrow ain't tonight just
Kick back, let the universe align

Come on, don't say goodnight
With the stars in the sky
Let's wait 'til tomorrow paints the sun across the night

That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history

But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you, I want another
But maybe we could hold off for one sec
So we could keep this tension in check
There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other

Full of honey
Just to make him sweet
Crystal balling
Just to help him see
What he's been missing
So come and get it

Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken

You were singing all the songs I don't know

It's not about who you are or your fancy car

That's all you ever need to know

I'm in love with you

I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart for me
My California king

These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh, oh, oh

On a balcony, in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

""Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you

And she'll never know your story like I do

I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words

We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needin'
Everything that we should be

And she's got everythin' that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
But I can't even see anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking how we don't have a song""

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

The first date; ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Asking God if he could play it again

Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah

You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

I put it in my wallet

And now your song is on repeat
And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat

Hope that they don't think I forget about them

The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreaming that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
Yeah

I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world

I would make you stay

Last Friday night
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed, but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a ménage à trois

Yeah, I think we broke the law

She pushed me in the pool at our last school reunion
She laughs at my dreams but I dream about her laughter
Strange as it seems, she's the one I'm after

'Cause she's bittersweet
She knocks me off of my feet
And I can't help myself, I don't want anyone else
She's a mystery, she's too much for me
But I keep comin' back for more
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for
Just the girl I'm lookin' for
She's just the girl I'm lookin' for

She can't keep a secret for more than an hour
She runs on one hundred proof attitude power
And the more she ignores me, the more I adore her
What can I do? I'd do anything for her

That I will fall for you over again
Don't make me change my mind

I swear it's true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You're impossible to find

This is not what I intended
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart

Snuck in her room right after she left
And put petals on the ground
Her head on his shoulder they walk down the hall
I'm left to wonder will I ever fall in love
And where is he now?

She's with him, I'm in the back seat
Know it's not right but it hurts when they're laughing
I've never been where they are

I wanna be blown away
I wanna be swept off my feet
I wanna meet the one who makes it hard for me to breathe
I wanna be lost in love
I wanna be your dream come true
I wanna be scared of how strong I feel for you
Just call me beautiful
Call me beautiful
Call me beautiful
Call me b-e-a-utiful

Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

Now I can't breathe, no, I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on

Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

Distance was a friend of mine
Catching breath in a web of lies
I've spent most of my life

Riding waves, playing acrobat
Shadowboxing the other half
Learning how to react
I've spent most of my time

Catching my breath, letting it go
Turning my cheek for the sake of the show
Now that you know, this is my life
I won't be told what's supposed to be right

Catch my breath
No one can hold me back, I ain't got time for that
Catch my breath
Won't let them get me down, it's all so simple now

Addicted to the love I found
Heavy heart, now a weightless cloud
Making time for the ones that count

But is it too late to try?

All of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights

Still stuck in that time, when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

All those fairy tales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh
